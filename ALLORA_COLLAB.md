# Collaborating with Allora Network

The collaboration with **Allora Network** to integrate its topic outputs into the **AI-Powered Restaking Optimization Agent**, a tool for automating multi-layer restaking in DeFi to optimize profits and assess risks. The focus is on leveraging Allora’s precomputed inferences (e.g., yield predictions, risk scores) to enhance the agent’s functionality.

---

## Purpose

The agent requires reliable, real-time data for suggesting restaking strategies (e.g., ETH → stETH → eETH → Curve) and evaluating risks. Instead of building custom prediction models, we use outputs from Allora’s topics—specialized inferences from their decentralized AI network—to streamline development and improve accuracy.

---

## Collaboration Details

- **Objective:** Fetch outputs from Allora topics (e.g., APR for Lido/EigenLayer, risk scores) and integrate them into the agent’s logic.
- **Relevant Topics:**
  - Yield predictions (APR across staking/restaking protocols).
  - Risk assessments (slashing, contract risks).
  - Market volatility forecasts.
- **Method:**
  - **CLI Query:** Use `allorad` CLI to retrieve inferences:
    ```bash
    allorad query inferences --topic-id <TOPIC_ID> --node https://allora-testnet-rpc.com
    ```
    - Example output: `{"value": "13.5", "timestamp": "2025-03-04 12:00:00"}` (APR).
  - **API (Future):** Post-mainnet, use REST API:
    ```python
    import requests
    response = requests.get("https://api.allora.network/topics/<TOPIC_ID>/latest")
    output = response.json()["value"]
    ```
- **Integration Points:**
  - **Suggestions:** Map yield outputs to `/suggest` endpoint (e.g., APR = 13.5%).
  - **Risk:** Use risk topic outputs for `/risk` endpoint (e.g., risk = 1.8%).

---

## Implementation

- **Setup:** Install `allorad` CLI and configure wallet ([Allora Docs](https://docs.allora.network)).
- **Timeline:** Adds 2-3 days to fetch and test topic outputs.
- **Fallback:** If topics are unavailable, use `ccxt` for prices or static data.
- **Status:** As of 3/2025, Allora is in testnet (mainnet expected Q1 2025). Use testnet topics initially.

## Benefits

- **Speed:** Quick integration of high-quality data.
- **Reliability:** Leverages Allora’s crowdsourced inferences.
- **Flexibility:** Easily expandable to new topics (e.g., gas fees).

This collaboration enhances the agent by outsourcing prediction tasks to Allora’s robust ecosystem.
